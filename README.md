# linreg
Linear Regression from scratch in Python.

Features two approaches:
1. Iteratively optimize the line of best fit.

2. Minimize the MSE (Mean Squared Error) through a formula and solve for the Regression coefficent (m) and the y-intercept (b).

Inspiration comes from [Luis Serrano's explanation of Linear Regression on Youtube](https://youtu.be/wYPUhge9w5c) and [DeepMind's Introduction to Tensorflow lecture](https://youtu.be/JO0LwmIlWw0).
